# Word-Frequency-in-Moby-Dick
This is a datacamp project. 
1. Web Scrape Data
2. Use NLP to get most frequent words
In this Project, the novel Moby Dick from the website Project Gutenberg (which contains a large corpus of books) is scraped using the Python package requests. Words from this web data are extracted using BeautifulSoup. Finally, data is analyzed, the distribution of words using the Natural Language ToolKit (nltk). The natural language processing tools used here apply to much of the data that data scientists encounter as a vast proportion of the world's data is unstructured data and includes a great deal of text.
